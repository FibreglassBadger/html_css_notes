    <body><h3>CSS Foundations</h3>
        CSS is made of rules these are the selector and a semi-colon separated list declarations, with each of those declarations been made up of a property:value pair

        <h4>Selectors</h4>
        Selectors refer to the html element to which the CSS rules apply. The following list are the most common:
        <h5>Universal Selector</h5>
        This will select elements of any type and the syntax(structure) is an asterisk. In the below example every element would have the color: purple; stye applied to it.

        <h5>Type Selectors</h5>
        A type selector will select all elements of the given element type. The syntax would be the given element. The example belows shows that < div > would be selected and not < p >
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/type-selector.png" target="type" width="650" height="415">
        <h5>Class Selectors</h5>
        These will select anything made using < div class >in the given quotations. The first example shows the adding of a class and the second is the class selector.
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/class-selector.png" target="class selector" width="700" height="325"> 
        <p></p>The syntax is a period immediately followed by the class attribute (the case sensitive quoted word). This example it would be alert-text. You can also add multiple classes to the attribute listed with just a space.
        <h5>ID Selectors</h5>
        These are similar to class selectors, the difference is that an element can only have one ID. Using < div id ="" and a #"" instead of a full stop.

        <p>Don't overuse these, can use class instead.</p>
        <h5>The Grouping Selector</h5>
        If two or more groups of elements share some of the same style declarations then we can use a comma-seperated list to cut down on repetition.
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/grouping-selector1.png" target="grouping selector example 1" width="675" height="340">
        <p></p>
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/grouping-selector2.png" target="grouping selector example 2" width="700" height="400">
        <p>Both of the examples above have the same effect, it condenses the code and makes it easier to edit color/background color for both at once.</p>
        <h5>Chaining Selectors</h5>
        Selectors can be chained together as a list without any separation using a fullstop as before. For example if you had two classes that looked liked "div class="subsection header">Latest Posts< /div" and "p class="subsection preview". So if you wanted to apply a rule with classes that included subsection and header then the following syntax would look like:
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/chaining-selectors1.png" target="chaining selector example 1" width="600" height="150">
        <p>You can do the same with the id class by just placing a # before instead of a full stop:</p>
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/chaining-selectors2.png" target="chaining selector example 2" width="600" height="470">
        <p>In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like div and p would give us the selector divp, which wouldn’t work since the selector would try to find a literal < divp > element, which doesn’t exist.</p>
        <h5>Descendant Combinator</h5>
        Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors at once, differently than chaining or grouping. There are four types of combinators but are only going to focus on Descendant. This selector will only work if they have an ancestor (parent, child, grandparent etc) that matches the previous selector.
        <p>So .ancestor .child would only select an element with the class .child as long as .ancestor came before it and would ignore all the .child on their own or without an ancestor</p>
        <img src="../html_css_notes/images/descendant-combinator.png" target="descendant combinator" width="700" height="550">
        <p>So only class B and C would have been selected in the above example. There’s really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so .one .two .three .four would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of four if it has an ancestor with a class of three, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of two, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.</p>
