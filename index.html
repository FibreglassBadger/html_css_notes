    </head>

    <body>
        HTML puts information on a web page, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!

        <p>HTML builds the structure</p>
        
        <p>CSS helps you tweak HTML, altering layout, style and presentation</p>
        
        <p>Java pushes the interactivity for a more modern audience. JavaScript can change structure of both HTML and CSS. Almost limitless possibilities</p>
        
        <p>If you want to focus primarily on improving the front-end elements of your website, the most important languages to learn include HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. As for the back-end, you should consider learning languages like Python, Ruby, and PHP.</p>
        
        <p>HTML uses elements in the form of tags, here's a good list of all the tags and what they do:</p>
        
        <a href="http://developer.Mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element">http://developer.Mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element</a>
        
        
        <h4>The Basics</h4>
        
        
        < h1 > to < h6 > makes the words larger to smaller
        
        <p>  < p > is used to create paragraphs, break up sentences</p>
        
        < em > places <em>italics</em>
        <p>< strong > puts text in <strong>bold</strong></p>
        
        
        
        
        For example
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, < em > <em>consectetur adipiscing elit</em> < em >, sed do < strong > <strong>eiusmod</strong> < strong >tempor
           incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
        
        <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
           nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>
        
        
        
        
        <p><strong>Lists</strong></p>
           Unordered list are made using the < ul > element and each item starting and ending with < li >
           this will bullet point the lines
        
        
        <p>ordered lists are created with < ol > where the order <em>does</em> matter
           and it will number the lines instead of bullet pointing them</p>
        <  ol ><ol>
          <p>< li >Item 1</li>< li > </p>
          <p>< li >Item 2</li>< li > </p>
          <p>< li >Item 3</li>< li > </p>
        < /ol ></ol>
        <p>makes</p>
        <ol><ol>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
          </ol>
    
        <p><strong>Images and Links</strong></p>
        <p>Anchor elements are used to create links < a >for example< /a ></p>
        <p>It needs a HTML attribute which is usually made up of two parts, a name and a value. This example uses a href hyperlink reference. The value of the href attribute is the destination the link goes.
        <p>For example
        < a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me< /a ></p>
        
        <p>Anchor tags can be used to link all kinds of resources from the web ie images videos etc</p>
        
        <p>The target attribute tells the link where to open. By default it will open the link in the current tab. For a new tab you can set it to _blank.</p> For example
        
        < a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me< /a ></p>

        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me</a></p>
        
        <p>Rel is used to describe the relationship between the page and the linked document.</p>
        <p>noopener prevents access for opened link to previous page</p>
        <p>noreferer does the same vice verser. Done as good practise even though modern securty doesnt need it.</p>
        
        <p>Absolute links are pages to another site and will always be made up of protocol://domain/path eg https://www.theodinproject.com/about
        <p>Relative links are ways to navigate your own website. Can be shorter eg pages/about.html</p>
        
        <p><strong>Images</strong></p> 
        <p>To display an image in HTML we use < img > which is self closing. It uses src attribute similar to hrf. It can be embedded in absolute and relative paths.</p>
        <p>eg  < img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" ></p>
        
        <p>alt= (Alternate) atribute must be used after the image location to decribe what the image shows, helping the visually impaired.
        <p>eg < img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" ></p>
        
        <p>Parent directories- To use an image that is not in the directory of the target web page then the following must be used < img src="../images/dog.jpg">  or ../targetfile   so that it searches for it from the parent directory</p>
        
        <P><strong>Commit Messages</strong></P>
        <p>Commit messages will be viewed by other developers working on your code to see what changes were made and why.
            They are good for reminding you of the changes you made and why</p>
            <p>A bad commit would be 'fix a bug' a good commit has a subject 'this is a change I made to the codebase' and body describing what your commit fixed</p>
            The messages need to be clear and concise so that they are easy to understand.
            <p>Commits are like snapshot of your code and its action. This should show a time line of your progression. Commit when you get a piece of code to function, fix a typo or fix a bug. There will be times when your code may completely break but going back through your commits (timeline) to before the code broke would be very helpful</p>
            <p> The seven rules of commits are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
                <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
                    <li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
                    <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
                    <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
                    <li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
                    <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
            </ol> 
            <p><strong>Uploading to git and making public</strong></p>
            To make pages viewable anywhere on the internet from github, then you must click on your specific repo from the accounts page then on the left hand side click <strong>pages</strong>. Change <strong>Branch</strong> from <em>none</em> to <em>main</em> and then click save. The page will then be found at <em>your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name</em>
